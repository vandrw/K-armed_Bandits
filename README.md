## How to Run
To run the code, go to a terminal, set the present working directory as K-armed_Bandits and run the following commands:

```
make
make run
```

If you wish to create all the data at once and show a graph for each problem, run the command:
```
make all
```
This might take between 5 and 10 minutes, depending on hardware.
